## Robot Localization Using Particle Filter
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a Particle Filter algorithm to estimate the position of a mobile robot in an unknown environment using noisy sensor data and motion models.</li>
  <li>Designed and simulated a probabilistic framework to handle uncertainty in both robot movement and sensor observations, enabling robust localization over time.</li>
  <li>Used a set of weighted particles to represent possible robot poses, updating beliefs based on motion and sensor likelihoods using Bayesian inference.</li>
  <li>Tested the system in MATLAB with simulated environments to evaluate convergence speed, accuracy, and robustness under varying noise conditions.</li>
  <li>Visualized robot trajectories, belief distributions, and particle evolution using MATLAB plotting tools to analyze performance.</li>
  <li>Validated the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness in handling non-linear, non-Gaussian problems, making it suitable for real-world robotic applications.</li>
  <li>Documented implementation details for future integration into SLAM systems or autonomous navigation pipelines.</li>
</ul>
